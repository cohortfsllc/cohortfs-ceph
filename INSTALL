Installation Instructions
*************************

If pulling from git, you first need to build the configure script with

$ ./autogen.sh

Then,

$ ./configure
$ make

Note that if the FUSE library is not found, the user-space fuse client
will not be built.

If you are doing development, you may want to do

$ CXXFLAGS="-g -pg" ./configure

or similar to avoid the default (-g -O2), which includes optimizations
(-O2).
