1. Make sure you have all components as described here:

    http://ceph.com/docs/master/install/build-ceph/

2. On Ubuntu I also seemed to have to do the following:

   sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
   sudo apt-get install libblkid-dev

3. cd <top-directory-of-branch>

4. mkdir build

5. cd build

6. <one of>

    a. cmake -DWITH_RADOSGW=OFF -DWITH_CDS=OFF -DCDS_LIBS= ..
    b. cmake ..
    c. cmake -DWITH_TESTS=OFF ..

7. make


# Note: at one point there were some issues with using
  CHECK_INCLUDE_FILES rather than CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE_CXX for C++
  include files. This no longer seems to be an issue, but I keep the
  information here in case the issue ever raises its head.

    diff --cc CMakeLists.txt

      --CHECK_INCLUDE_FILES("boost/random/discrete_distribution.hpp" HAVE_BOOST_RANDOM_DISCRETE_DISTRIBUTION)
      ++CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE_CXX("boost/random/discrete_distribution.hpp" HAVE_BOOST_RANDOM_DISCRETE_DISTRIBUTION)

      --CHECK_INCLUDE_FILES("leveldb/filter_policy.h" HAVE_LEVELDB_FILTER_POLICY)
      ++CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE_CXX("leveldb/filter_policy.h" HAVE_LEVELDB_FILTER_POLICY)
