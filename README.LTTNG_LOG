=================================

Prerequisites

lttng-tools
lttng-modules-dkms
liblttng-ust-dev

CMake Congfiguration
====================

$ cmake ..[path] -DWITH_RADOSGW=OFF -DWITH_TESTS=OFF

Catching the logs
=================
before the ceph daemons are started create and start a new lttng event:
$ sudo lttng create [session name]
$ sudo lttng enable -u -a 
$ sudo lttng start

You can also run $ lttng list -u to view all the user space tracepoint events to make sure 

Every new tracing sessions traces are written to a directory under  ~/lttng-traces/[session name...]. Once your session is over, run lttng stop and lttng destroy to stop the tracing and be able to start a new secession respectively. 

to view log output clone babeltrace-ceph and
$ make ceph_log_plugin
$ sudo ./ceph_log_plugin ~/lttng-traces/[session name...]
