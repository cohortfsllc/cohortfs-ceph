==============================
 Install Ceph Storage Cluster
==============================

This guide describes installing Ceph packages manually. This procedure
is only for users who are not installing with a deployment tool such as
``ceph-deploy``, ``chef``, ``juju``, etc.

.. tip:: You can also use ``ceph-deploy`` to install Ceph packages, which may
   be more convenient since you can install ``ceph`` on multiple hosts with
   a single command.


Installing with APT
===================

Once you have added either release or development packages to APT, you should
update APT's database and install Ceph::

	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ceph ceph-mds


Installing with RPM
===================

To install pre-requisite packages, execute the following::

	sudo yum install snappy leveldb gdisk python-argparse gperftools-libs

Once you have added either release or development packages, or added a
``ceph.repo`` file to ``/etc/yum.repos.d``, you can install Ceph packages. ::

	sudo yum install ceph

Installing a Build
==================

If you build Ceph from source code, you may install Ceph in user space
by executing the following::

	sudo make install

If you install Ceph locally, ``make`` will place the executables in
``usr/local/bin``. You may add the Ceph configuration file to the
``usr/local/bin`` directory to run Ceph from a single directory.
