 Upgrading Ceph
================

You can upgrade daemons in your Ceph cluster while the cluster is
online and in service! The upgrade process is relatively simple:

#. Use ``ceph-deploy`` to upgrade the packages for multiple hosts,
   or login to each host and upgrade the Ceph package manually.
#. Restart each daemon.
#. Ensure your cluster is healthy.

.. important:: Once you upgrade a daemon, you cannot downgrade it.

Certain types of daemons depend upon others. For example, Ceph Metadata Servers
and Ceph Object Gateways depend upon Ceph Monitors and Ceph OSD Daemons. We
recommend upgrading daemons in this order:

#. Ceph Monitors (or Ceph OSD Daemons)
#. Ceph OSD Daemons (or Ceph Monitors)
#. Ceph Metadata Servers
#. Ceph Object Gateways

As a general rule, we recommend upgrading all the daemons of a specific type
(e.g., all ``ceph-osd`` daemons, all ``ceph-mon`` daemons, etc.) to ensure that
they are all on the same release. We also recommend that you upgrade all the
daemons in your cluster before you try to exercise new functionality in a
release.

Each release of Ceph may have some additional steps. Refer to the following
sections to identify release-specific procedures for your cluster before
using the upgrade procedures.


Argonaut to Bobtail
===================

When upgrading from Argonaut to Bobtail, you need to be aware of several things:

#. Authentication now defaults to **ON**, but used to default to **OFF**.
#. Monitors use a new internal on-wire protocol.
#. RBD ``format2`` images require upgrading all OSDs before using it.

Ensure that you update package repository paths. For example::

	sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
	echo deb http://ceph.com/debian-bobtail/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list

See the following sections for additional details.

Authentication
--------------

The Ceph Bobtail release enables authentication by default. Bobtail also has
finer-grained authentication configuration settings. In previous versions of
Ceph (i.e., actually v 0.55 and earlier), you could simply specify::

	auth supported = [cephx | none]

This option still works, but is deprecated.  New releases support
``cluster``, ``service`` and ``client`` authentication settings as
follows::

	auth cluster required = [cephx | none]  # default cephx
	auth service required = [cephx | none] # default cephx
	auth client required = [cephx | none] # default cephx,none

.. important:: If your cluster does not currently have an ``auth
   supported`` line that enables authentication, you must explicitly
   turn it off in Bobtail using the settings below.::

	auth cluster required = none
	auth service required = none

   This will disable authentication on the cluster, but still leave
   clients with the default configuration where they can talk to a
   cluster that does enable it, but do not require it.

.. important:: If your cluster already has an ``auth supported`` option defined in
   the configuration file, no changes are necessary.

See `Ceph Authentication - Backward Compatibility`_ for details.


Monitor On-wire Protocol
------------------------

We recommend upgrading all monitors to Bobtail. A mixture of Bobtail and
Argonaut monitors will not be able to use the new on-wire protocol, as the
protocol requires all monitors to be Bobtail or greater. Upgrading  only a
majority of the nodes (e.g., two out of three) may expose the cluster to a
situation where a single additional failure may compromise availability (because
the non-upgraded daemon cannot participate in the new protocol).  We recommend
not waiting for an extended period of time between ``ceph-mon`` upgrades.


RBD Images
----------

The Bobtail release supports ``format 2`` images! However, you should not create
or use ``format 2`` RBD images until after all ``ceph-osd`` daemons have been
upgraded.  Note that ``format 1`` is still the default. You can use the new
``ceph osd ls`` and ``ceph tell osd.N version`` commands to doublecheck your
cluster. ``ceph osd ls`` will give a list of all OSD IDs that are part of the
cluster, and you can use that to write a simple shell loop to display all the
OSD version strings: ::

      for i in $(ceph osd ls); do
          ceph tell osd.${i} version
      done


Argonaut to Cuttlefish
======================

To upgrade your cluster from Argonaut to Cuttlefish, please read this
section, and the sections on upgrading from Argonaut to Bobtail and
upgrading from Bobtail to Cuttlefish carefully. When upgrading from
Argonaut to Cuttlefish, **YOU MUST UPGRADE YOUR MONITORS FROM ARGONAUT
TO BOBTAIL v0.56.5 FIRST!!!**. All other Ceph daemons can upgrade from
Argonaut to Cuttlefish without the intermediate upgrade to Bobtail.

.. important:: Ensure that the repository specified points to Bobtail, not
   Cuttlefish.

For example::

	sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
	echo deb http://ceph.com/debian-bobtail/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list

We recommend upgrading all monitors to Bobtail before proceeding with the
upgrade of the monitors to Cuttlefish. A mixture of Bobtail and Argonaut
monitors will not be able to use the new on-wire protocol, as the protocol
requires all monitors to be Bobtail or greater. Upgrading only a majority of the
nodes (e.g., two out of three) may expose the cluster to a situation where a
single additional failure may compromise availability (because the non-upgraded
daemon cannot participate in the new protocol).  We recommend not waiting for an
extended period of time between ``ceph-mon`` upgrades. See `Upgrading
Monitors`_ for details.

.. note:: See the `Authentication`_ section and the
   `Ceph Authentication - Backward Compatibility`_ for additional information
   on authentication backward compatibility settings for Bobtail.

Once you complete the upgrade of your monitors from Argonaut to
Bobtail, and have restarted the monitor daemons, you must upgrade the
monitors from Bobtail to Cuttlefish. Ensure that you have a quorum
before beginning this upgrade procedure. Before upgrading, remember to
replace the reference to the Bobtail repository with a reference to
the Cuttlefish repository. For example::

	sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
	echo deb http://ceph.com/debian-cuttlefish/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list

See `Upgrading Monitors`_ for details.

The architecture of the monitors changed significantly from Argonaut to
Cuttlefish. See `Monitor Config Reference`_ and `Joao's blog post`_ for details.
Once you complete the monitor upgrade, you can upgrade the OSD daemons and the
MDS daemons using the generic procedures. See `Upgrading an OSD`_ and `Upgrading
a Metadata Server`_ for details.


Bobtail to Cuttlefish
=====================

Upgrading your cluster from Bobtail to Cuttlefish has a few important
considerations. First, the monitor uses a new architecture, so you should
upgrade the full set of monitors to use Cuttlefish. Second, if you run multiple
metadata servers in a cluster, ensure the metadata servers have unique names.
See the following sections for details.

Replace any ``apt`` reference to older repositories with a reference to the
Cuttlefish repository. For example::

	sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
	echo deb http://ceph.com/debian-cuttlefish/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list


Monitor
-------

The architecture of the monitors changed significantly from Bobtail to
Cuttlefish. See `Monitor Config Reference`_ and `Joao's blog post`_ for
details. This means that v0.59 and pre-v0.59 monitors do not talk to each other
(Cuttlefish is v.0.61). When you upgrade each monitor, it will convert its
local data store to the new format. Once you upgrade a majority of monitors,
the monitors form a quorum using the new protocol and the old monitors will be
blocked until they get upgraded. For this reason, we recommend upgrading the
monitors in immediate succession.

.. important:: Do not run a mixed-version cluster for an extended period.


MDS Unique Names
----------------

The monitor now enforces that MDS names be unique. If you have multiple metadata
server daemons that start with with the same ID (e.g., mds.a) the second
metadata server will implicitly mark the first metadata server as ``failed``.
Multi-MDS configurations with identical names must be adjusted accordingly to
give daemons unique names. If you run your cluster with one  metadata server,
you can disregard this notice for now.


ceph-deploy
-----------

The ``ceph-deploy`` tool is now the preferred method of provisioning new clusters.
For existing clusters created via ``mkcephfs`` that would like to transition to the
new tool, there is a migration path, documented at `Transitioning to ceph-deploy`_.

Cuttlefish to Dumpling
======================

When upgrading from Cuttlefish (v0.61-v0.61.7) you may perform a rolling
upgrade. However, there are a few important considerations. First, you must
upgrade the ``ceph`` command line utility, because it has changed significantly.
Second, you must upgrade the full set of monitors to use Dumpling, because of a
protocol change.

Replace any reference to older repositories with a reference to the
Dumpling repository. For example, with ``apt`` perform the following::

	sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
	echo deb http://ceph.com/debian-dumpling/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list

With CentOS/Red Hat distributions, remove the old repository. ::

	sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/ceph.repo

Then add a new ``ceph.repo`` repository entry with the following contents.

.. code-block:: ini

	[ceph]
	name=Ceph Packages and Backports $basearch
	baseurl=http://ceph.com/rpm/el6/$basearch
	enabled=1
	gpgcheck=1
	type=rpm-md
	gpgkey=https://ceph.com/git/?p=ceph.git;a=blob_plain;f=keys/release.asc


.. note:: Ensure you use the correct URL for your distribution. Check the
   http://ceph.com/rpm directory for your distribution.

.. note:: Since you can upgrade using ``ceph-deploy`` you will only need to add
   the repository on Ceph Client nodes where you use the ``ceph`` command line
   interface or the ``ceph-deploy`` tool.


Dumpling to Emperor
===================

When upgrading from Dumpling (v0.64) you may perform a rolling
upgrade.

Replace any reference to older repositories with a reference to the
Emperor repository. For example, with ``apt`` perform the following::

	sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
	echo deb http://ceph.com/debian-emperor/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list

With CentOS/Red Hat distributions, remove the old repository. ::

	sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/ceph.repo

Then add a new ``ceph.repo`` repository entry with the following contents and
replace ``{distro}`` with your distribution (e.g., ``el6``, ``rhel6``, etc).

.. code-block:: ini

	[ceph]
	name=Ceph Packages and Backports $basearch
	baseurl=http://ceph.com/rpm-emperor/{distro}/$basearch
	enabled=1
	gpgcheck=1
	type=rpm-md
	gpgkey=https://ceph.com/git/?p=ceph.git;a=blob_plain;f=keys/release.asc


.. note:: Ensure you use the correct URL for your distribution. Check the
   http://ceph.com/rpm directory for your distribution.

.. note:: Since you can upgrade using ``ceph-deploy`` you will only need to add
   the repository on Ceph Client nodes where you use the ``ceph`` command line
   interface or the ``ceph-deploy`` tool.


Command Line Utility
--------------------

In V0.65, the ``ceph`` commandline interface (CLI) utility changed
significantly. You will not be able to use the old CLI with Dumpling. This means
that you must upgrade the  ``ceph-common`` library on all nodes that access the
Ceph Storage Cluster with the ``ceph`` CLI before upgrading Ceph daemons. ::

	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ceph-common

Ensure that you have the latest version (v0.67 or later). If you do not,
you may need to uninstall, auto remove dependencies and reinstall.

See `v0.65`_ for details on the new command line interface.

.. _v0.65: http://ceph.com/docs/master/release-notes/#v0-65


Ceph Deploy
-----------

Before upgrading Ceph daemons, upgrade the ``ceph-deploy`` tool. ::

	sudo pip install -U ceph-deploy

Or::

	sudo apt-get install ceph-deploy

Or::

	sudo yum install ceph-deploy python-pushy


Monitor
-------

Dumpling (v0.67) ``ceph-mon`` daemons have an internal protocol change. This
means that v0.67 daemons cannot talk to v0.66 or older daemons.  Once you
upgrade a majority of monitors,  the monitors form a quorum using the new
protocol and the old monitors will be blocked until they get upgraded. For this
reason, We recommend upgrading all monitors at once (or in relatively quick
succession) to minimize the possibility of downtime.

.. important:: Do not run a mixed-version cluster for an extended period.


Upgrade Procedures
==================

The following sections describe the upgrade process.

.. important:: Each release of Ceph may have some additional steps. Refer to
   release-specific sections for details **BEFORE** you begin upgrading daemons.


Upgrading Monitors
------------------

To upgrade monitors, perform the following steps:

#. Upgrade the Ceph package for each daemon instance.

   You may use ``ceph-deploy`` to address all monitor nodes at once.
   For example::

	ceph-deploy install --stable {stable release} ceph-node1[ ceph-node2]
	ceph-deploy install --stable dumpling mon1 mon2 mon3

   You may also use the package manager for your Linux distribution on
   each individual node. To upgrade packages manually on each Debian/Ubuntu
   host, perform the following steps . ::

	ssh {mon-host}
	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ceph

   On CentOS/Red Hat hosts, perform the following steps::

	ssh {mon-host}
	sudo yum update && sudo yum install ceph


#. Restart each monitor. For Debian/Ubuntu distributions, use::

	sudo restart ceph-mon id={hostname}

   For CentOS/Red Hat distributions, use::

	sudo /etc/init.d/ceph restart {mon-id}

   For CentOS/Red Hat distributions deployed with ``ceph-deploy``,
   the monitor ID is usually ``mon.{hostname}``.

#. Ensure each monitor has rejoined the quorum. ::

	ceph mon stat

Ensure that you have completed the upgrade cycle for all of your Ceph Monitors.


Upgrading an OSD
----------------

To upgrade a Ceph OSD Daemon, perform the following steps:

#. Upgrade the Ceph OSD Daemon package.

   You may use ``ceph-deploy`` to address all Ceph OSD Daemon nodes at
   once. For example::

	ceph-deploy install --stable {stable release} ceph-node1[ ceph-node2]
	ceph-deploy install --stable dumpling mon1 mon2 mon3

   You may also use the package manager on each node to upgrade packages
   manually. For Debian/Ubuntu hosts, perform the following steps on each
   host. ::

	ssh {osd-host}
	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ceph

   For CentOS/Red Hat hosts, perform the following steps::

	ssh {osd-host}
	sudo yum update && sudo yum install ceph


#. Restart the OSD, where ``N`` is the OSD number. For Debian/Ubuntu, use::

	sudo restart ceph-osd id=N

   For multiple OSDs on a host, you may restart all of them with Upstart. ::

	sudo restart ceph-osd-all

   For CentOS/Red Hat distributions, use::

	sudo /etc/init.d/ceph restart N


#. Ensure each upgraded Ceph OSD Daemon has rejoined the cluster::

	ceph osd stat

Ensure that you have completed the upgrade cycle for all of your
Ceph OSD Daemons.


Upgrading a Metadata Server
---------------------------

To upgrade a Ceph Metadata Server, perform the following steps:

#. Upgrade the Ceph Metadata Server package. You may use ``ceph-deploy`` to
   address all Ceph Metadata Server nodes at once, or use the package manager
   on each node. For example::

	ceph-deploy install --stable {stable release} ceph-node1[ ceph-node2]
	ceph-deploy install --stable dumpling mon1 mon2 mon3

   To upgrade packages manually, perform the following steps on each
   Debian/Ubuntu host. ::

	ssh {mon-host}
	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ceph-mds

   Or the following steps on CentOS/Red Hat hosts::

	ssh {mon-host}
	sudo yum update && sudo yum install ceph-mds


#. Restart the metadata server. For Debian/Ubuntu, use::

	sudo restart ceph-mds id={hostname}

   For CentOS/Red Hat distributions, use::

	sudo /etc/init.d/ceph restart mds.{hostname}

   For clusters deployed with ``ceph-deploy``, the name is usually either
   the name you specified on creation or the hostname.

#. Ensure the metadata server is up and running::

	ceph mds stat


Upgrading a Client
------------------

Once you have upgraded the packages and restarted daemons on your Ceph
cluster, we recommend upgrading ``ceph-common`` and client libraries
(``librbd1`` and ``librados2``) on your client nodes too.

#. Upgrade the package::

	ssh {client-host}
	apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ceph-common librados2 librbd1 python-ceph

#. Ensure that you have the latest version::

	ceph --version

If you do not have the latest version, you may need to uninstall, auto remove
dependencies and reinstall.


Transitioning to ceph-deploy
============================

If you have an existing cluster that you deployed with ``mkcephfs`` (usually
Argonaut or Bobtail releases),  you will need to make a few changes to your
configuration to  ensure that your cluster will work with ``ceph-deploy``.


Monitor Keyring
---------------

You will need to add ``caps mon = "allow *"`` to your monitor keyring if it is
not already in the keyring. By default, the monitor keyring is located under
``/var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-$id/keyring``. When you have added the ``caps``
setting, your monitor keyring should look something like this::

	[mon.]
		key = AQBJIHhRuHCwDRAAZjBTSJcIBIoGpdOR9ToiyQ==
		caps mon = "allow *"

Adding ``caps mon = "allow *"`` will ease the transition from ``mkcephfs`` to
``ceph-deploy`` by allowing ``ceph-create-keys`` to use the ``mon.`` keyring
file in ``$mon_data`` and get the caps it needs.


Use Default Paths
-----------------

Under the ``/var/lib/ceph`` directory, the ``mon`` and ``osd`` directories need
to use the default paths.

- **OSDs**: The path should be ``/var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-$id``
- **MON**: The path should be  ``/var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-$id``

Under those directories, the keyring should be in a file named ``keyring``.
