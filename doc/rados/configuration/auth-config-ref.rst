========================
 Cephx Config Reference
========================

.. index:: cephx; authentication; cephx configuration

To identify users and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks, Ceph provides
its ``cephx`` authentication system to authenticate users and daemons. See `Ceph
Authentication & Authorization`_ for an introduction to ``cephx``
authentication. See the `Cephx Guide`_ for details on enabling/disabling,
creating users and setting user capabilities.


Enable/Disable Authentication
=============================

Depending on the version, Ceph either enables or disables authentication by
default. Use the following settings to expressly enable or disable Ceph.
See `Ceph Authentication`_ for additional details.


.. topic:: Authentication Enablement Defaults

   Ceph version 0.54 and earlier versions disable authentication by default.
   If you want to use Ceph authentication, you must specifically enable it
   for version 0.54 and earlier versions.

   Ceph version 0.55 and later version enable authentication by default. If you
   do not want to use Ceph authentication, you must specifically disable it
   for versions 0.55 and later versions.


.. topic:: Authentication Granularity

   Ceph version 0.50 and earlier versions use ``auth supported`` to enable or
   disable authentication between the :term:`Ceph Client` and the :term:`Ceph
   Storage Cluster`. Ceph authentication in earlier versions only authenticates
   users sending message traffic between the client and the cluster, so it does
   not have fine-grained control.

   Ceph version 0.51 and later versions use fine-grained control, which allows
   you to require authentication of the client by the cluster
   (``auth service required``), authentication of the cluster by the client
   (``auth client required``), and authentication of a daemon within the
   cluster by another daemon within the cluster (``auth cluster required``).



``auth supported``

.. deprecated:: 0.51

:Description: Indicates whether to use authentication. If not specified,
              it defaults to ``none``, which means it is disabled.

:Type: String
:Required: No
:Default: ``none``


``auth cluster required``

.. versionadded:: 0.51

:Description: If enabled, the Ceph Storage Cluster daemons (i.e., ``ceph-mon``,
              ``ceph-osd``, and ``ceph-mds``) must authenticate with
              each other. Valid settings are ``cephx`` or ``none``.

:Type: String
:Required: No
:Default: Version 0.54 and earlier ``none``. Version 0.55 and later ``cephx``.


``auth service required``

.. versionadded:: 0.51

:Description: If enabled, the Ceph Storage Cluster daemons require Ceph Clients
              to authenticate with the Ceph Storage Cluster in order to access
              Ceph services. Valid settings are ``cephx`` or ``none``.

:Type: String
:Required: No
:Default: Version 0.54 and earlier ``none``. Version 0.55 and later ``cephx``.



``auth client required``

.. versionadded:: 0.51

:Description: If enabled, the Ceph Client requires the Ceph Storage Cluster to
              authenticate with the Ceph Client. Valid settings are ``cephx``
              or ``none``.

:Type: String
:Required: No
:Default: Version 0.54 and earlier ``none``. Version 0.55 and later ``cephx``.


.. index:: keys; keyring

Keys
====

When you run Ceph with authentication enabled, ``ceph`` administrative commands
and Ceph Clients require authentication keys to access the Ceph Storage Cluster.

The most common way to provide these keys to the ``ceph`` administrative
commands and clients is to include a Ceph keyring under the ``/etc/ceph``
directory. For Cuttlefish and later releases using ``ceph-deploy``, the filename
is usually ``ceph.client.admin.keyring`` (or ``$cluster.client.admin.keyring``).
If you include the keyring under the ``/etc/ceph`` directory, you don't need to
specify a ``keyring`` entry in your Ceph configuration file.

We recommend copying the Ceph Storage Cluster's keyring file to nodes where you
will run administrative commands, because it contains the ``client.admin`` key.

You may use ``ceph-deploy admin`` to perform this task. See `Create an Admin
Host`_ for details. To perform this step manually, execute the following::

	sudo scp {user}@{ceph-cluster-host}:/etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring

.. tip:: Ensure the ``ceph.keyring`` file has appropriate permissions set
   (e.g., ``chmod 644``) on your client machine.

You may specify the key itself in the Ceph configuration file using the ``key``
setting (not recommended), or a path to a keyfile using the ``keyfile`` setting.


``keyring``

:Description: The path to the keyring file.
:Type: String
:Required: No
:Default: ``/etc/ceph/$cluster.$name.keyring,/etc/ceph/$cluster.keyring,/etc/ceph/keyring,/etc/ceph/keyring.bin``


``keyfile``

:Description: The path to a key file (i.e,. a file containing only the key).
:Type: String
:Required: No
:Default: None


``key``

:Description: The key (i.e., the text string of the key itself). Not recommended.
:Type: String
:Required: No
:Default: None


.. index:: signatures

Signatures
==========

In Ceph Bobtail and subsequent versions, we prefer that Ceph authenticate all
ongoing messages between the entities using the session key set up for that
initial authentication. However, Argonaut and earlier Ceph daemons do not know
how to perform ongoing message authentication. To maintain backward
compatibility (e.g., running both Botbail and Argonaut daemons in the same
cluster), message signing is **off** by default. If you are running Bobtail or
later daemons exclusively, configure Ceph to require signatures.

Like other parts of Ceph authentication, Ceph provides fine-grained control so
you can enable/disable signatures for service messages between the client and
Ceph, and you can enable/disable signatures for messages between Ceph daemons.


``cephx require signatures``

:Description: If set to ``true``, Ceph requires signatures on all message
              traffic between the Ceph Client and the Ceph Storage Cluster, and
              between daemons comprising the Ceph Storage Cluster.

:Type: Boolean
:Required: No
:Default: ``false``


``cephx cluster require signatures``

:Description: If set to ``true``, Ceph requires signatures on all message
              traffic between Ceph daemons comprising the Ceph Storage Cluster.

:Type: Boolean
:Required: No
:Default: ``false``


``cephx service require signatures``

:Description: If set to ``true``, Ceph requires signatures on all message
              traffic between Ceph Clients and the Ceph Storage Cluster.

:Type: Boolean
:Required: No
:Default: ``false``


``cephx sign messages``

:Description: If the Ceph version supports message signing, Ceph will sign
              all messages so they cannot be spoofed.

:Type: Boolean
:Default: ``true``


Time to Live
============

``auth service ticket ttl``

:Description: When the Ceph Storage Cluster sends a Ceph Client a ticket for
              authentication, the Ceph Storage Cluster assigns the ticket a
              time to live.

:Type: Double
:Default: ``60*60``
