 General Config Reference
==========================


``fsid``

:Description: The filesystem ID. One per cluster.
:Type: UUID
:Required: No.
:Default: N/A. Usually generated by deployment tools.


``admin socket``

:Description: The socket for executing administrative commands on a daemon,
              irrespective of whether Ceph Monitors have established a quorum.

:Type: String
:Required: No
:Default: ``/var/run/ceph/$cluster-$name.asok``


``pid file``

:Description: Each running Ceph daemon has a running
              process identifier (PID) file.

:Type: String
:Required: No
:Default: N/A. The default path is ``/var/run/$cluster/$name.pid``. The
          PID file is generated upon start-up.


``chdir``

:Description: The directory Ceph daemons change to once they are
              up and running. Default ``/`` directory recommended.

:Type: String
:Required: No
:Default: ``/``


``max open files``

:Description: If set, when the :term:`Ceph Storage Cluster` starts, Ceph sets
              the  ``max open fds`` at the OS level (i.e., the max # of file
              descriptors). It helps prevents Ceph OSD Daemons from running out
              of file descriptors.

:Type: 64-bit Integer
:Required: No
:Default: ``0``


``fatal signal handlers``

:Description: If set, we will install signal handlers for SEGV, ABRT, BUS, ILL,
              FPE, XCPU, XFSZ, SYS signals to generate a useful log message

:Type: Boolean
:Default: ``true``
