	# By default, Ceph makes 2 replicas of objects. If you want to make three
	# copies of an object the default value--a primary copy and two replica
	# copies--reset the default values as shown in 'osd pool default size'.
	# If you want to allow Ceph to write a lesser number of copies in a degraded
	# state, set 'osd pool default min size' to a number less than the
	# 'osd pool default size' value.

	osd pool default size = 3  # Write an object 3 times.
	osd pool default min size = 1 # Allow writing one copy in a degraded state.

	# Ensure you have a realistic number of placement groups. We recommend
	# approximately 100 per OSD. E.g., total number of OSDs multiplied by 100
	# divided by the number of replicas (i.e., osd pool default size). So for
	# 10 OSDs and osd pool default size = 3, we'd recommend approximately
	# (100 * 10) / 3 = 333.

	osd pool default pg num = 333
	osd pool default pgp num = 333
