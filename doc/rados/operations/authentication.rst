 Cephx Guide
=============

Ceph provides two authentication modes:

- **None:** Any user can access data without authentication.
- **Cephx**: Ceph requires user authentication in a manner similar to Kerberos.

If you disable ``cephx``, you do not need to generate keys using the procedures
described here. If you re-enable ``cephx`` and have already generated keys, you
do not need to generate the keys again.

.. important:: The ``cephx`` protocol does not address data encryption in transport
   (e.g., SSL/TLS) or encryption at rest.

For additional information, see our `Cephx Intro`_, our `Cephx Configuration
Reference`_ and `ceph-authtool manpage`_.

.. _Cephx Intro: ../auth-intro
.. _ceph-authtool manpage: ../../../man/8/ceph-authtool


Configuring Cephx
=================

There are several important procedures you must follow to enable the ``cephx``
protocol for your Ceph cluster and its daemons:

#. You must generate a secret key for the default ``client.admin`` user so the
   administrator can execute Ceph commands.

#. You must generate a monitor secret key and distribute it to all monitors in
   the cluster.

#. You must follow the remaining steps in `Enabling Cephx`_ to enable
   authentication.

See the `Cephx Configuration Reference`_ for additional details.

.. tip:: This guide is for manual configuration. If you use a deployment tool
   such as ``ceph-deploy``, it is very likely that the tool will perform at
   least the first two steps for you. Verify that your deployment tool
   addresses these steps so that you don't overwrite your keys inadvertantly.


.. _client-admin-key:

The ``client.admin`` Key
------------------------

When you first install Ceph, each Ceph command you execute on the command line
assumes that you are the ``client.admin`` default user. When running Ceph with
``cephx`` enabled, you need to have a key for the ``client.admin`` user to run
``ceph`` commands as the administrator.

.. important:: To run Ceph commands on the command line with
   ``cephx`` enabled, you need to create a key for the ``client.admin``
   user, and create a secret file under ``/etc/ceph``.

The following command will generate and register a ``client.admin``
key on the monitor with admin capabilities and write it to a keyring
on the local file system.  If the key already exists, its current
value will be returned.	::

	sudo ceph auth get-or-create client.admin mds 'allow' osd 'allow *' mon 'allow *' > /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring

Ensure that the keyring has appropriate permissions so that the current user
can use the keyring.

See `Enabling Cephx`_ step 1 for stepwise details to enable ``cephx``.


Monitor Keyrings
----------------

Ceph requires a keyring for the monitors. Use the `ceph-authtool`_ command to
generate a secret monitor key and keyring. ::

      sudo ceph-authtool {keyring} --create-keyring --gen-key -n mon.

A cluster with multiple monitors must have identical keyrings for all
monitors. So you must copy the keyring to each monitor host under the
following directory::

  /var/lib/ceph/mon/$cluster-$id

See `Enabling Cephx`_ step 2 and 3 for stepwise details to enable ``cephx``.

.. _ceph-authtool: ../../../man/8/ceph-authtool


.. _enable-cephx:

Enabling Cephx
--------------

When ``cephx`` is enabled, Ceph will look for the keyring in the default search
path, which includes ``/etc/ceph/ceph.$name.keyring``.  You can override this
location by adding a ``keyring`` option in the ``[global]`` section of your
`Ceph configuration`_ file, but this is not recommended.

Execute the following procedures to enable ``cephx`` on a cluster with ``cephx``
disabled. If you (or your deployment utility) have already generated the keys,
you may skip the steps related to generating keys.

#. Create a ``client.admin`` key, and save a copy of the key for your client host::

	ceph auth get-or-create client.admin mon 'allow *' mds 'allow *' osd 'allow *' -o /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring

   **Warning:** This will clobber any existing
   ``/etc/ceph/client.admin.keyring`` file. Do not perform this step if a
   deployment tool has already done it for you. Be careful!

#. Create a keyring for your cluster and generate a monitor secret key. ::

	ceph-authtool --create-keyring /tmp/ceph.mon.keyring --gen-key -n mon. --cap mon 'allow *'

#. Copy the monitor keyring into a ``ceph.mon.keyring`` file in every monitor's
   ``mon data`` directory. For example, to copy it to ``mon.a`` in cluster ``ceph``,
   use the following::

    cp /tmp/ceph.mon.keyring /var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-a/keyring

#. Generate a secret key for every OSD, where ``{$id}`` is the OSD number::

    ceph auth get-or-create osd.{$id} mon 'allow rwx' osd 'allow *' -o /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-{$id}/keyring

#. Generate a secret key for every MDS, where ``{$id}`` is the MDS letter::

    ceph auth get-or-create mds.{$id} mon 'allow rwx' osd 'allow *' mds 'allow *' -o /var/lib/ceph/mds/ceph-{$id}/keyring

#. Enable ``cephx`` authentication for versions ``0.51`` and above by setting
   the following options in the ``[global]`` section of your `Ceph configuration`_
   file::

    auth cluster required = cephx
    auth service required = cephx
    auth client required = cephx

#. Or, enable ``cephx`` authentication for Ceph versions ``0.50`` and below by
   setting the following option in the ``[global]`` section of your `Ceph
   configuration`_ file. **NOTE:** Deprecated as of version ``0.50``. ::

    auth supported = cephx


#. Start or restart the Ceph cluster. See `Operating a Cluster`_ for details.

For details on bootstrapping a monitor manually, see `Manual Deployment`_.

.. _disable-cephx:

Disabling Cephx
---------------

The following procedure describes how to disable Cephx. If your cluster
environment is relatively safe, you can offset the computation expense of
running authentication. **We do not recommend it.** However, it may be easier
during setup and/or troubleshooting to temporarily disable authentication.

#. Disable ``cephx`` authentication for versions ``0.51`` and above by setting
   the following options in the ``[global]`` section of your `Ceph configuration`_
   file::

    auth cluster required = none
    auth service required = none
    auth client required = none
    auth supported = none

#. Or, disable ``cephx`` authentication for versions ``0.50`` and below
   (deprecated as of version 0.51) by setting the following option in the
   ``[global]`` section of your `Ceph configuration`_ file::

    auth supported = none

#. Start or restart the Ceph cluster. See `Operating a Cluster`_ for details.



Daemon Keyrings
---------------

With the exception of the monitors, Ceph generates daemon keyrings in the same
way that it generates user keyrings.  By default, the daemons store their
keyrings inside their data directory.  The default keyring locations, and the
capabilities necessary for the daemon to function, are shown below.

``ceph-mon``

:Location: ``$mon_data/keyring``
:Capabilities: N/A

``ceph-osd``

:Location: ``$osd_data/keyring``
:Capabilities: ``mon 'allow rwx' osd 'allow *'``

``ceph-mds``

:Location: ``$mds_data/keyring``
:Capabilities: ``mds 'allow rwx' mds 'allow *' osd 'allow *'``

``radosgw``

:Location: ``$rgw_data/keyring``
:Capabilities: ``mon 'allow rw' osd 'allow rwx'``


Note that the monitor keyring contains a key but no capabilities, and
is not part of the cluster ``auth`` database.

The daemon data directory locations default to directories of the form::

  /var/lib/ceph/$type/$cluster-$id

For example, ``osd.12`` would be::

  /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-12

You can override these locations, but it is not recommended.


Cephx Administration
====================

Cephx uses shared secret keys for authentication, meaning both the client and
the monitor cluster have a copy of the client's secret key. The authentication
protocol is such that both parties are able to prove to each other they have a
copy of the key without actually revealing it.  This provides mutual
authentication, which means the cluster is sure the user possesses the secret
key, and the user is sure that the cluster has a copy of the secret key.

Default users and pools are suitable for initial testing purposes. For test bed
and production environments, you should create users and assign pool access to
the users.


.. _add-a-key:

Add a Key
---------

Keys enable a specific user to access the monitor, metadata server and
cluster according to capabilities assigned to the key.  Capabilities are
simple strings specifying some access permissions for a given server type.
Each server type has its own string.  All capabilities are simply listed
in ``{type}`` and ``{capability}`` pairs on the command line::

	sudo ceph auth get-or-create client.{username} {daemon1} {cap1} {daemon2} {cap2} ...

For example, to create a user ``client.foo`` with access 'rw' for
daemon type 'osd' and 'r' for daemon type 'mon'::

   sudo ceph auth get-or-create client.foo osd 'allow rw' mon 'allow r' > keyring.foo

.. note:: User names are associated to user types, which include ``client``
   ``osd``, ``mon``, and ``mds``. In most cases, you will be
   creating keys for ``client`` users.

After you add a key to the cluster keyring, go to the relevant client(s) and
copy the keyring from the cluster host to the client(s). ::

	sudo scp {user}@{ceph-cluster-host}:/etc/ceph/ceph.keyring /etc/ceph/ceph.keyring

.. tip:: Ensure the ``ceph.keyring`` file has appropriate permissions set
   (e.g., ``chmod 644``) on your client machine.


.. _auth-delete-key:

Delete a Key
------------

To delete a key for a user or a daemon, use ``ceph auth del``::

	ceph auth del {daemon-type}.{ID|username}

Where ``{daemon-type}`` is one of ``client``, ``osd``, ``mon``, or ``mds``,
and ``{ID|username}`` is the ID of the daemon or the username.

After you delete a key from the cluster keyring, go to the relevant client(s) and
copy the keyring from the cluster host to the client(s). ::

	sudo scp {user}@{ceph-cluster-host}:/etc/ceph/ceph.keyring /etc/ceph/ceph.keyring

.. tip:: Ensure the ``ceph.keyring`` file has appropriate permissions set
   (e.g., ``chmod 644``) on your client machine.



List Keys in your Cluster
-------------------------

To list the keys registered in your cluster::

	sudo ceph auth list


Cephx Commandline Options
=========================

When Ceph runs with Cephx enabled, you must specify a user name and a secret key
on the command line. Alternatively, you may use the ``CEPH_ARGS`` environment
variable to avoid re-entry of the user name and secret. ::

	ceph --id {user-name} --keyring=/path/to/secret [commands]

For example::

	ceph --id client.admin --keyring=/etc/ceph/ceph.keyring [commands]


Ceph supports the following usage for user name and secret:

``--id`` | ``--user``

:Description: Ceph identifies users with a type and an ID (e.g., ``TYPE.ID`` or
              ``client.admin``, ``client.user1``). The ``id``, ``name`` and
              ``-n`` options enable you to specify the ID portion of the user
              name (e.g., ``admin``, ``user1``, ``foo``, etc.). You can specify
              the user with the ``--id`` and omit the type. For example,
              to specify user ``client.foo`` enter the following::

               ceph --id foo --keyring /path/to/keyring health
               ceph --user foo --keyring /path/to/keyring health


``--name``

:Description: Ceph identifies users with a type and an ID (e.g., ``TYPE.ID`` or
              ``client.admin``, ``client.user1``). The ``--name`` and ``-n``
              options enables you to specify the fully qualified user name.
              You must specify the user type (typically ``client``) with the
              user ID. For example::

               ceph --name client.foo --keyring /path/to/keyring health
               ceph -n client.foo --keyring /path/to/keyring health


``--keyring``

:Description: The path to the keyring containing one or more user name and
              secret. The ``--secret`` option provides the same functionality,
              but it does not work with Ceph RADOS Gateway, which uses
              ``--secret`` for another purpose. You may retrieve a keyring with
              ``ceph auth get-or-create`` and store it locally. This is a
              preferred approach, because you can switch user names without
              switching the keyring path. For example::

               sudo rbd map foo --pool rbd myimage --id client.foo --keyring /path/to/keyring


``--keyfile``

:Description: The path to the key file containing the secret key for the user
              specified by ``--id``, ``--name``, ``-n``, or ``--user``. You may
              retrieve the key for a specific user with ``ceph auth get`` and
              store it locally. Then, specify the path to the keyfile.
              For example::

               sudo rbd map foo --pool rbd myimage --id client.foo --keyfile /path/to/file


.. note:: Add the user and secret to the ``CEPH_ARGS`` environment variable so that
   you don’t need to enter them each time. You can override the environment
   variable settings on the command line.


Backward Compatibility
======================

.. versionadded:: Bobtail

In Ceph Argonaut v0.48 and earlier versions, if you enable ``cephx``
authentication, Ceph only authenticates the initial communication between the
client and daemon; Ceph does not authenticate the subsequent messages they send
to each other, which has security implications. In Ceph Bobtail and subsequent
versions, Ceph authenticates all ongoing messages between the entities using the
session key set up for that initial authentication.

We identified a backward compatibility issue between Argonaut v0.48 (and prior
versions) and Bobtail (and subsequent versions). During testing, if you
attempted  to use Argonaut (and earlier) daemons with Bobtail (and later)
daemons, the Argonaut daemons did not know how to perform ongoing message
authentication, while the Bobtail versions of the daemons insist on
authenticating message traffic subsequent to the initial
request/response--making it impossible for Argonaut (and prior) daemons to
interoperate with Bobtail (and subsequent) daemons.

We have addressed this potential problem by providing a means for Argonaut (and
prior) systems to interact with Bobtail (and subsequent) systems. Here's how it
works: by default, the newer systems will not insist on seeing signatures from
older systems that do not know how to perform them, but will simply accept such
messages without authenticating them. This new default behavior provides the
advantage of allowing two different releases to interact. **We do not recommend
this as a long term solution**. Allowing newer daemons to forgo ongoing
authentication has the unfortunate security effect that an attacker with control
of some of your machines or some access to your network can disable session
security simply by claiming to be unable to sign messages.

.. note:: Even if you don't actually run any old versions of Ceph,
   the attacker may be able to force some messages to be accepted unsigned in the
   default scenario. While running Cephx with the default scenario, Ceph still
   authenticates the initial communication, but you lose desirable session security.

If you know that you are not running older versions of Ceph, or you are willing
to accept that old servers and new servers will not be able to interoperate, you
can eliminate this security risk.  If you do so, any Ceph system that is new
enough to support session authentication and that has Cephx enabled will reject
unsigned messages.  To preclude new servers from interacting with old servers,
include the following in the ``[global]`` section of your `Ceph
configuration`_ file directly below the line that specifies the use of Cephx
for authentication::

	cephx require signatures = true    ; everywhere possible

You can also selectively require signatures for cluster internal
communications only, separate from client-facing service::

	cephx cluster require signatures = true    ; for cluster-internal communication
	cephx service require signatures = true    ; for client-facing service

An option to make a client require signatures from the cluster is not
yet implemented.

**We recommend migrating all daemons to the newer versions and enabling the
foregoing flag** at the nearest practical time so that you may avail yourself
of the enhanced authentication.
