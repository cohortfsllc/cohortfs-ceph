Overview
The ObjectStore implementation contained here implements a
CohortFS Ceph object file system on ZFS primitives, using a CohortFS
descendant of libzfswrap, the user-space library implementation of
ZFS adapted from earlier Linux-FUSE ZFS by developers at the French
atomic energy agency (CEA).

Model and Assumptions
Some key assumptions of the implementation are:

1. each ZFStore OSD instance uniquely manages the storage in a
  single pool, whose name is given by ObjectStore::path

2. each ZFStore instance contains a root object file system,
   <pool-name>/osdfs, of which all is collections are child file
   systems--hence, the collection "bar" in the ZFStore instance
   with path "foo" has the fully-qualified name "foo/osdfs/bar"

3. the ZFStore::statfs() operation stats the root (osdfs) file
   system for the associated path; the operation does not attempt
   to verify that the base pool exists, or that it is healthy,
   see next

4. to simplify management, the ZFStore::mkfs() operation checks
   for the existence of a pool matching the instance path, and will
   conditionally create it based on the values of ZFStore-specific
   configuration parameters, as follows:

   [osd]
   zfstore_zpool_create = true
   zfstore_zpool_devices = <type>;<pathseg...;pathseg

   At present, the pool type should be "", and a single Unix
   path provided as device path segment.  Other combinations of
   pool types and multiple device paths probably work, but YMMV.
