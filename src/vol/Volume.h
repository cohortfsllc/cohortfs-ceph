  /* Factory Protocol

     Know then that a factory is called with a bufferlist from which
     it is to decode itself.  It is also called with the version and
     volume type. (The volume type should be obvious since it's what
     the factory is dispatched on, but just in case someone decides
     to use the same function for two streams that are almost
     identical.)

     The very first thing the factory must do is allocate (with new)
     an empty (as in default constructor) volume of the required
     type.

     It must then call the common_decode method on its parent. (This
     is virtual, so that volume classes that share functionality can
     share a parent and have common structure decoded by it.  Any
     common_decode in a child of Volume must call its parent's
     common_decode before doing anything, as well.)

     The factory method must then do its own specific implementation
     and return a shared pointer to the volume.

     Factories may inspect common variables AFTER they have been set,
     but MUST NOT duplicate generic validity checks that are the
     domain of the common decode method. */
